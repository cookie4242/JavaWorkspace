		 * This is a small assignment to practice using logic statements,
		 * booleans and variables in general.
		 * 
		 * Objective: Build the logic statements to determine if the evil
		 * lord can take over the town of Innocentville. Below are the conditions
		 * that must be true for the lord to take over. All values must be stored
		 * in fully named variables of the type of your choosing. A few helpful reminders
		 * on syntax are also below so you don't forget.
		 * 
		 * Print "The mighty lord has taken over Innocentville" if below is all true
		 *   - The lord has more minions then Innocentville has guards
		 *   - The lord rules at least 4 of the 7 Kingdoms
		 *   - The lord is liked by at least 70% of his minions
		 *   - The lord has the magic amulet
		 *   - The lord does not have the magic staff
		 * 
		 * Print "The mighty lord returned home unvictorious" if below is all true
		 *   - The lord has less than 4 of the 7 magic kingdoms
		 *   - The villagers have a cannon
		 *   - The villagers have more guards then the lord has minions, but less than 200 guards
		 *   - The villagers do not have the magic potato
		 *   
		 * Print "The mighty lord was utterly defeated" if everything in the first if condition
		 * is false and the villagers have the magic potato.
		 *   
		 * Note: Only one of the above statements may be printed when the program runs.
		 * 
		 * When starting this, first make all variables, then slowly work through the logic, one bullet
		 * point at a time. If you have any questions, let me know.

		/*
		 * To print something to the console use: System.out.println("String goes here");
		 * 
		 * The variable types you can use: boolean, int, float, String and char
		 * 
		 * A list of the different questions you can ask are listed below (conditional checks)
		 * Assume you have two variables int a; and int b; for the examples below
		 * 
		 *      a < b   (a less than b)
		 *      a > b   (a greater than b)
		 *      a == b  (a equal to b)
		 *      a != b  (a not equal to b)
		 *      
		 * To combine questions you can use the following
		 * 
		 *      conditionA && conditionB   (conditionA and conditionB must be true)
		 *      conditionA || conditionB   (Either conditionA or conditionB must be true)
		 *      
		 * Also remember that any of the math you can use on paper you can do in a computer.
		 * Assume again the variables int a; and int b; are available as well as int c;
		 * 
		 *      a = b * c;    (a equals b times c)
		 *      a = b / c;    (a equals b divided by c)
		 *      a = b + c;    (a equals b plus c)
		 *      a = b - c;    (a equals b minus c)
		 *      
		 *      
		 * Finally, remember that you can run code based off asking questions using if statements
		 * as shown below.
		 * 
		 * 	if (condition is true)
		 * 	{
		 *	 
		 * 	}
		 * 
		 *	 There are other ways of specifying if statements as well
		 *	 
		 * 	if (condition is true)
		 * 	{
		 * 	    //Code runs if statement is true
		 * 	}
		 * 	else if (condition is true)
		 * 	{
		 * 	    //Code runs if first statements is false and this statement is true
		 * 	}
		 * 	else
		 * 	{
		 *	    //Runs if all statements above are false
		 * 	}
